# Demeter

Demeter is a backup git repository that contains config files on my current
macOS enviroment. Althought all files were created using macOS commandline
utilities, they should work fine with any standard UNIX-like system that uses
`zsh` as it's default shell.

# Restore

So you fucked it up. Now what? No problemo, i've got you covered:

1. Run this:

```bash
curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Altair-Bueno/Demeter/master/restore.sh" | bash
```

2. Install brew packages
3. Set up `zsh` as the default shell
4. Set up GitHub access token on git using the OS `credential store`. Here are
   instructions for
   [macOS](https://gist.github.com/nepsilon/0fd0c779f76d7172f12477ba9d71bb66)
   and
   [Linux](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5343068/is-there-a-way-to-cache-https-credentials-for-pushing-commits/18362082#18362082)

I'm using [powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k). The, 
[p10k](backup/.p10k.zsh) script is already on this backup, so just install the
